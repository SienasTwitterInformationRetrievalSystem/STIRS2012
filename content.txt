The Little Soul and the Sun distills the essential message of the Conversations with God books and sews it into a story that even children can identify with. Frank Riccio's poignant illustrations are the perfect companion to Walsch's parable of a little soul who discovers that it is "the light" but still wants to know how it "feels" to be the light. This proves to be a problem, as God created nothing else but the light. God's solution, with the help of another soul, is to surround the little soul with darkness, so that it can feel what being the light is like. This deceptively simple tale of self-discovery carries such a profound message that adults as well as children will read it over and over, each time learning a little more about who we really are and why we are here on earth. --Brian Patterson From Publishers Weekly Though his Conversations with God, Book 1 may be a bestseller, Walsch's attempts to scale down part of that book into a work for children may well leave young readers, and their parents, scratching their heads. In this utterly confusing parable, a little soul discusses at length with God how he can learn to experience who he really is and which "part of special" he wants to be. The little soul decides he wants to be forgiving; thus another little soul soon obliges by offering to do something "not-so-nice," so that the first little soul can experience forgiveness. Amid the cryptic phrasing and the often cumbersome sentence structures, some strong imagery and positive Christian attitudes do come through. Such messages as "everybody is special, each in their own way" and "it is special to be kind; it is special to be creative" are important for all children to hear, regardless of their faith. Unfortunately, some readers may not stick with this story long enough to glean such lessons. Riccio's scene of child-angels in monk-like frocks walking on what appear to be clouds will surely inspire further questions about perceptions of Heaven. Ages 6-10.

This review is from: The Little Soul and the Sun: A Children's Parable Adapted from Conversations With God (Hardcover) When I first read the book Conversations With God a few years ago, I was deeply touched. Much of the insights presented in this unusual conversation were a wonderfully fresh way of seeing All is One and that All is Love. A year or so later, I was browsing the children's section of the bookstore and came upon The Little Soul and the Sun: A Children's Parable Adapted From Conversations With God. I read it right there and it brought tears to my eyes. Here it is some years later, and I've just bought this delightful book for my son as a Christmas present. This beautiful story is illustrated in lavish pastels by Frank Riccio, and features a parable about Little Soul--one who wants to experience itself as Who I Am. You see, Little Soul knows that it is Light--but feels that knowing isn't enough. So Little Soul asks God if it can actually feel what is means to be the Light. So God asks Little Soul how it can experience the Light when it is already as a candle in the Sun, along with the other billions of souls who make up the brilliance of the Sun? Little Soul entreats God to think of something--some way in which it can experience what it feels like to be Light. God answers Little Soul "Since you cannot see yourself as the Light when you are in the Light, we'll surround you with darkness." Little Soul asks "What's darkness?" and God replies "It is that which you are not." Little Soul asks God if it will be afraid, but God says "only if you choose to be...there is nothing, really, to be afraid of, unless you decide that there is." One of the central themes of Conversations With God is that in order for God to experience Itself, It had to be contrasted with something else--something "other". You cannot experience dark without light, up without down, now without then, fast without slow. The purpose of duality is to experience parts of the God-self in all Its glory. In a sense, we are all a part of God, and God exploded into a million Souls to experience Itself. However, when We made the journey Earthward, We forgot where We came from--and Who we were. Little Soul and God continue the conversation, and talk about how everyone is special in their own way--each manifesting a different part of "special". Some parts of special include kindness, creativity, and patience. Little Soul decides that the part of "special" it wants to experience is the part of special known as forgiveness. A multitude of Souls gather around God and Little Soul to hear this extraordinary conversation, and God sweeps an arm towards them: "There is nothing to forgive" God says. Little Soul could hardly believe what God said. "Everything I have made is perfect. There is not a single soul in all of creation less perfect than you. Look around you." Little Soul grumbles that this wasn't fun at all! How would it experience itself as One Who Forgives if there was noone to forgive? Just then, Friendly Soul offers to help him, volunteering to come into Little Soul's next lifetime so it can do something for Little Soul to forgive. Little Soul was incredulous, and aks why Friendly Soul, who was such a magnificent Being of perfect Light, would want to become dense and dark--slowing it's vibration in order to do this bad thing for Little Soul to forgive? "Simple", The Friendly Soul replies. "I would do it because I love you." Friendly Soul goes on to explain that both it and Little Soul have been male and femaile, good and bad, victim and villian--All of It. "Thus have we come together, you and I, many times before; each bringing to the other the exact and perfect opportunity to Express and to Experience Who We Really Are." In being the "bad one" this time around, Friendly Soul will give Little Soul the opportunity to experience itself as One Who Forgives. Friendly Soul becomes serious and confirms that it will have to become dense and dark to do this act--and that both it and Little Soul may forget Who They Were. Friendly Soul asks Little Soul a favor: to remember, in the moment that it strikes and smites Little Soul--doing the worst that it can possibly imagine--that Little Soul will remember Who Friendly Soul Really Is. An agreement was made, and Little Soul goes forth into a new lifetime, excited to be the Light--and to experience that part of "special" called Forgivness. "...whenever a new soul brought joy or sadness--and especially if it brought sadness--the Little Soul thought of what God had said. 'Always remember', God had smiled, 'I have sent you nothing but angels.'" My favorite passage of the book, which is the major theme of the New Age, is "And so", God concluded, "when you are surrounded with darkness, do not shake your fist and raise your voice and curse the darkness. Rather, be a Light unto the darkness, and don't be mad about it. Then you will know Who You Really Are, and all others will know, too. Let your Light so shine that everyone will know how special you are!"

To teach our young ones, we must first understand the story. This book should be read by every ADULT, and lovingly passed on to our children. I've had this book for sometime, and have waited for a grandchild to give it to. But now I feel that I am "hoarding" it. There are so many who need to hear its message!

ABC News Publishes, Removes Story Attacking GOP on Rape, Abortion | LifeNews.com LifeNews.com ABC News Publishes, Removes Story Attacking GOP on Rape, Abortion by Scott Whitlock | Washington, DC | LifeNews.com | 1/31/11 1:19 PM Print Email Opinion ABCNews.com on Monday republished, then removed an article from Mother Jones magazine on Republicans “redefining rape.” The piece briefly appeared on the network’s website with no explanation that it was by the editor of the liberal magazine. The article, by Nick Baumann, featured both the incendiary headline from Mother Jones, “The House GOP’s Plan to Redefine Rape” and the nasty sub-headline: “Drugged, raped, and pregnant? Too bad. Republicans are pushing to limit rape and incest cases eligible for government abortion funding.” Unlike CBSNews.com, which has an opinion and analysis section, this article received no label. One could easily assume Baumann was simply an ABC News journalist. In the piece, Baumann, attacked the “anti-choice” Republicans: Rape is only really rape if it involves force. So says the new House Republican majority as it now moves to change abortion law. For years, federal laws restricting the use of government funds to pay for abortions have included exemptions for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. (Another exemption covers pregnancies that could endanger the life of the woman.) But the “No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act,” a bill with 173 mostly Republican co-sponsors that House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has dubbed a top priority in the new Congress, contains a provision that would rewrite the rules to limit drastically the definition of rape and incest in these cases. The only experts cited in the article are those attacking congressional Republicans, including Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America. That would be fine, of course, had the article not been featured on ABCNews.com (or had it been identified as commentary). National Review’s Kathryn Jean Lopez created a screenshot of the (now gone) ABC News article and the Mother Jones original: LifeNews.com Note: Scott Whitlock is a news analyst for the Media Research Center and a contributing writer to NewsBusters, it’s blog where this item first appeared. Scott’s blogs have been featured in the “Inside Politics” section of the Washington Times and linked to on the Drudge Report. He is a graduate of George Mason University.

(Photo: Contributed) God move over: GMO is here by Contributed - Story: 59762 Jan 31, 2011 / 5:00 am Forget about both divinity and natural selection. Man has taken hold of the wheel and is now steering the creation of new life forms. Can scientists really outsmart both God and Mother Nature? Can researchers create GMOs (genetically modified organisms) without negative and unforeseeable consequences? Either way, what will we call ‘nature’ when it is not natural anymore? If the biblical proverb has merit and “pride comes before a fall," is mankind about to take its biggest tumble ever? Scientists have created very interesting combinations: Human DNA is experimentally injected into the embryos of cows and the calves are dying of ruptured ovaries. Researchers consider this a ‘learning curve'. I think most people worldwide agree that human genes belong in humans, plant genes belong in plants and animal genes belong in the original animal. Researchers should not be ‘Rubik’s-Cubing’ life forms together for profit under the disguise of science advancement. How did we get to this bizarre new reality? In the past, only objects could be patented for profit. The issue of patenting LIFE has never been voted by the Canadian parliament or the US Congress. Now, ‘LIFE’ itself can patented for profit, like any other commodity. Life can be owned, bought and sold. It is the new gold rush. The rush is to buy and sell genes and create new life forms. Currently, a life-bending ‘free-for-all’ is taking place with all the bio-tech companies racing to be the first in line at the Patent Office to stake their claim. The technology of gene-splicing is still a crude process. Researchers hack into one life form, remove genetic information and then transfer this data into another life form. It is called genetic modification or genetic engineering, which are terms that people don’t understand. Let’s just call it what it is: inter-species genetic rape. Where are these types of genetic experiments going to end? The answer may be your dinner plate. A genetically modified pig has been developed by Guelph University in Canada. The trademarked ‘Enviro-pig’ contains genetic material from a mouse and a sequence from E-Coli bacteria. Also proposed for our dinner plates is a genetically modified Salmon that has been re-created using eel genes. This GM salmon produces unnatural amounts of growth hormone. Another proposal is genetically modified apples that won’t brown after being cut or bruised. All of these new ‘foods’ are waiting for government approval. What about citizen approval? This science is in its infancy, as computers were in the 1970’s. Why should we release this new technology into the environment and our food supply? The GMO hardware is programmed into life forms, which reproduce. There is no delete button and there is no going back. The changes to the existing plants and animals will remain forever. This is not a sophisticated form of hybridization and is completely different from traditional breeding methods. Gene-splicing ‘mates’ completely different life forms together. Do you think that a tomato and a fish would ever swap genes naturally? Genetic manipulation breaks the natural species barrier. David Suzuki, Canada’s trusted geneticist and environmental expert, does not think gene-splicing technology is safe as it is currently practiced. He has personally authorized these quotes for public awareness. He says that all such genetic experiments “should be done under carefully monitored lab conditions, not out in the environment. I am a geneticist and I know some of these experiments will provide fundamental insights.  I’m just against the rush to apply these techniques.” Dr. Suzuki says, "What bothers me is we have governments that are supposed to be looking out for our health, for the safety of our environment, and they’re acting like cheerleaders for this technology, which is in its infancy and we have no idea what the technology is going to do.” “Anyone that says, 'Oh, we know that this is perfectly safe,' I say is either unbelievably stupid, or deliberately lying. The reality is, we don’t know. The experiments simply haven’t been done, and now we have become the guinea pigs. I am most definitely not in favor of release of GMOs in the food stream and given that it's too late, I favor complete labeling of GMO products.” Dr. David Suzuki – Geneticist. Most Canadians are unaware that GMO corn, for example, has already been re-created to produce its own pesticide internally. That toxin can’t be washed off. Another genetic alteration creates plants that can be sprayed with Roundup and other herbicides without being affected. All natural green plants will die, but not the GMO plants. The result is a field free of weeds and a crop loaded with extra toxins. This means more pesticide residue inside and on top of our food crops. Herbicides and insecticides are linked to cancer, Parkinson’s disease and are endocrine (hormone) disrupters. Other countries, including all 27 countries in the European Union have laws that label GMO foods, as does Australia, Japan and even South Korea. The Canadian government has already voted down two separate labeling bills and therefore Canadians still don’t have the right to know what GMO food they are eating. The USA started this technology and they have no labeling either. Strange that the two countries that are creating and promoting this ‘new food’ are so hush-hush about informing their own citizens. North Americans have been eating genetically modified food for some time, mostly through processed foods. I am confident that most people would not have supported these changes to the national food supply had there been a vote. The political powers in charge have subsidized these radical changes without their citizen’s knowledge or consent. Currently in Canada and in the USA, many farmers are growing genetically modified soy, canola, corn and white sugar beet (for making sugar). The USA also grows GMO cotton (used in many processed foods as cotton seed oil). As consumers, we are concerned with the safety of what we feed our families. Buying organically grown food is a way to avoid being a guinea pig for this massive food experiment. As there is no labeling, I personally avoid processed corn products and derivatives, soy and canola derivatives and sugar (unless from cane sugar). Corn syrup, corn chips, corn oil, soy infant formula, soy milk and canola oil are all examples of commonly consumed genetically modified food.  Anything containing the ingredients corn, soy, canola, or sugar could be potentially modified. Health Canada reports GMO crops are safe, but does not fund or conduct any health studies. Who says GMO food is safe? Like Canada, the US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) does not do any independent health tests. There are no human health studies, but independent animal studies show disturbing results, such as organ damage, pre-cancerous lesions, and problems with the liver and pancreas. Duke and Princeton University recently reported that HFCS (high fructose corn syrup) causes obesity and liver damage. So who does the studies for human safety on the new GMO food? The companies that alter the seeds, patent the seeds, own and profit from the sale of the seeds (or animals), conduct their own testing which they refuse to show the public. Is that not like letting the fox guard the hen house? Somehow, I think that this is not a good match for safety. "It’s safe," the industry answers. Didn’t we already hear that line from the tobacco industry? Remember pregnant women taking Thalidomide which was supposedly a safe drug according to the experts? Thalidomide was sold in a number of countries across the world from 1957 until 1961 when it was withdrawn from the market after being found to be a cause of birth defects in what has been called "one of the biggest medical tragedies of modern times". '"Trust us’ on GMO’s we are the experts,” says the food industry. Aren’t they the ones who thought that feeding dead cows to cows was okay, yet the brain wasting diseases like mad cow and Creutzfeldt-Jakob resulted? Our natural (non GMO) farmers all over North America are being sued for using the GMO technology without a license after the wind blows corporately owned GMO seeds into their fields. Their crops then belong to the corporation. The natural farmers also lose their export markets when their crops are found to be contaminated with GMO’s. Can you stop the wind? No. The natural growers can’t either. Is this the end of organic food and regular non-GMO food? Are we losing control of our food supply? The changes to the seeds through genetic modification are permanent and create a dependency on corporations like Monsanto that own most patents on gene-altered seeds. Currently, only a few food crops are genetically modified but the biotechnology corporations like Monsanto own over 14,000 patents. Monsanto is the corporation that also introduced poisons and neurotoxins like Agent Orange, 2-4D, dioxin, PCB, DDT and the food additive Aspartame. Where will it stop? If you haven’t seen the two documentaries ‘Food Inc’ and ‘The Future of Food', I urge you to do so. Canadians ought to pay attention to an important vote in early February on Bill C-474, which would require the government to conduct an analysis of export market harm before a new GMO is permitted. Contact your MP if you want a voice in this important issue. The fact is that our government does not consider economic, environmental, or ethical issues before GMOs are approved. 'LIFE’ itself should not be a shiny new vehicle for profiteers to make money. Is nothing sacred? The food that has served mankind throughout the ages is good enough and gambling with the future of the global food supply via genetic modifications is an experiment which could go terribly wrong.

The 20-year-old spent the first half of the season with the Blue Square North side and scored four times in 23 appearances. He returned to Pride Park at the start of January and spent a week on trial with npower League Two Burton Albion. AFC Telford, managed by former Sheffield Wednesday and England winger Andy Sinton, are currently 5th in the table and occupy the final playoff berth in Blue Square North. Derby County manager Nigel Clough told dcfc.co.uk: "Greg had a great deal of success at Telford earlier in the season and they have always been keen to take him back. "It will benefit him to keep playing first-team football there." Mills had loan spells at Solihull Moors and Macclesfield Town last season, as well as making two brief substitute appearances for the first-team.   Advertisement  Related Articles Mills Returns From Successful Telford Loan Mills Extends AFC Telford Loan Mills Heads Out On Loan MILLS BACK WITH THE RAMS MILLS JOINS MACCLESFIELD  Latest Articles Shackell Wants To Repay Clough's Faith Still Time To Pre-Order The New Shirt Exeter Pre-Season Prices Announced A Week On: Derby's 2011/12 Fixture List Wetherall Signs For The Football League View All >  Latest Videos Player: Jason Shackell Exclusive Player: Glick Delighted With Shackell Signing Player: Glick Reacts To The Fixtures Player Exclusive: Tyson Press Unveil Player: Tom Glick On Tyson View All >  News Archive Display Stories From Week 20/06/2011 13/06/2011 06/06/2011 30/05/2011 23/05/2011 16/05/2011 09/05/2011 02/05/2011 25/04/2011 18/04/2011 11/04/2011 04/04/2011 28/03/2011 21/03/2011 14/03/2011 07/03/2011 28/02/2011 21/02/2011 14/02/2011 07/02/2011 31/01/2011 24/01/2011 17/01/2011 10/01/2011 03/01/2011 27/12/2010 20/12/2010 13/12/2010 06/12/2010 29/11/2010 22/11/2010 15/11/2010 08/11/2010 01/11/2010 25/10/2010 18/10/2010 11/10/2010 04/10/2010 27/09/2010 20/09/2010 13/09/2010 06/09/2010 30/08/2010 23/08/2010 16/08/2010 09/08/2010 02/08/2010 26/07/2010 19/07/2010 12/07/2010 05/07/2010 28/06/2010 21/06/2010 14/06/2010 07/06/2010 View All > To access your account details or to change your email options log-in to your My Account Click here to logout  Official Club Partners You need to install the latest Flash plugin to view this content Derby County Business Finder is powered by city-visitor.com All materials on this website © Derby County Football Club & FLPTV Ltd.
